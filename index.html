    <h1 class="text-center m-5"> 🥐Croissants🥐</h1>
    <h3 class="text-center mb-3"> Is a pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl. </br> Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.</h3>
    <p class="text-center"> Croissants are layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. </p>
    <p class="text-center"> In the current days, croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries and served as dessert all around the world.</p>
    <h4 class="text-center mt-4 mb-3"> Croissants in Portugal</h4>
    <p class="text-center">The first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, "doce de ovo". </br> It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. </p>
